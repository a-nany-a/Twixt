# Twixt
This is a primitive version of the  online game Twixt ,It is made using C.

This game is similar to the online game twxit but is made using C only, there is autolinking
between fisible connections, the linking is not show in on the board but a message is printed
to let user know if two cells are connected.

I have made my board using zero indexing. so enter a number between 0 and 23 to play

I have set the boaed size to be 24*24.

I have made a makefile compile it using ./course_project

to quit input -1
